# Error Fix Documentation

## Issue Resolved: 500 Internal Server Error on File Upload

### Problem
The application was throwing a **Whitelabel Error Page** with a 500 Internal Server Error when users attempted to upload CSV and PNG files.

### Root Cause
The application has been updated to use **Aspose.OCR for Java** instead of Tesseract for better reliability and accuracy. Aspose.OCR provides superior OCR capabilities without requiring system-level dependencies, making it more robust for extracting UPS tracking numbers from uploaded images.

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. System Dependencies Fixed
- **Upgraded OCR Library**: Replaced Tesseract with Aspose.OCR for Java (version 25.6.0)
- **Improved Reliability**: No longer requires system-level OCR installation

#### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
- **Added comprehensive input validation** in the upload controller
- **Implemented try-catch blocks** to handle exceptions gracefully
- **Added file type validation** for both CSV and image files
- **Added file content validation** to ensure CSV files are not empty
- **Replaced generic 500 errors** with user-friendly error messages

#### 3. Improved User Experience
- **Created custom error page** (`error.html`) with helpful troubleshooting tips
- **Added specific error messages** for different types of failures:
  - OCR/Image processing issues
  - CSV parsing problems
  - File validation errors
- **Provided clear guidance** on file format requirements

### Current Status
âœ… **RESOLVED**: The application now processes file uploads successfully and generates the expected ZIP files containing:
- Packing list CSV with headers: PO#, ITEM#, QTY, NOTES
- Invoice CSV with headers: PO#, ITEM#, QTY, FOB (MS-DOS format)

### Testing Confirmed
- File upload functionality works correctly
- OCR processing extracts tracking numbers from images
- CSV parsing handles the required columns properly
- ZIP file generation and download works as expected
- Error handling provides meaningful feedback to users

### File Requirements (for users)
- **CSV File**: Must contain columns: PO/NO., ITEM NO., DESCRIPTION OF GOODS, QTY, UNIT VALUE (USD)
- **Image File**: Should be a clear image containing a UPS tracking number (format: 1Z + 16 alphanumeric characters)
- **Additional Parameters**: RMB amount, exchange rate, number of boxes, total weight

### Dependencies Added
- Aspose.OCR for Java 25.6.0
- English language data for OCR processing
- All existing Maven dependencies remain unchanged
