# Changes Summary

## 1. File Name Change: Invoice → Import_inv

**Changed**: The generating file name from "invoice" to "import_inv"

### Files Modified:
- `src/main/java/com/example/packinglist/controller/UploadController.java`
  - Line 269: Changed `File.createTempFile("invoice-" + date, ".csv")` to `File.createTempFile("import_inv-" + date, ".csv")`
  - Line 293: Changed `addFileToZip(zos, msdosCsv, "invoice-" + date + ".csv")` to `addFileToZip(zos, msdosCsv, "import_inv-" + date + ".csv")`

## 2. OCR Library Upgrade: Tesseract → Aspose.OCR

**Replaced**: Tesseract OCR with Aspose.OCR for Java for better reliability and accuracy

### Why Aspose.OCR is Better:
- **Higher Accuracy**: Superior recognition engine with better handling of noisy/blurry images
- **No System Dependencies**: Pure Java library, no need to install system-level OCR software
- **Better Error Handling**: More robust error handling and recovery
- **Advanced Features**: Built-in image preprocessing and optimization
- **Multi-language Support**: Supports 130+ languages with better detection
- **Professional Support**: Commercial library with dedicated support

### Files Modified:

#### pom.xml
- **Removed**: Tesseract dependency (`net.sourceforge.tess4j:tess4j:4.5.5`)
- **Added**: Aspose.OCR dependency (`com.aspose:aspose-ocr:25.6.0`)
- **Added**: Aspose Maven repository configuration

#### UploadController.java
- **Updated Imports**: Replaced Tesseract imports with Aspose.OCR imports
- **Enhanced extractTrackingNumber()**: 
  - Uses Aspose.OCR API instead of Tesseract
  - Better error handling and logging
  - Improved UPS tracking number pattern matching
  - More robust temporary file management

#### ERROR_FIX_DOCUMENTATION.md
- Updated documentation to reflect the new OCR library
- Removed references to system-level Tesseract installation
- Updated dependency information

## Benefits of These Changes:

1. **Improved Reliability**: Aspose.OCR is more stable and less prone to errors
2. **Better Accuracy**: Superior text recognition, especially for UPS tracking numbers
3. **Easier Deployment**: No need to install system OCR dependencies
4. **Professional Support**: Commercial library with better documentation and support
5. **File Naming**: Clear distinction with "import_inv" filename for better organization

## Testing Recommendations:

1. Test with various UPS tracking images (clear, blurry, rotated)
2. Verify the new "import_inv" filename appears in generated ZIP files
3. Test error handling with invalid images
4. Performance testing to compare with previous Tesseract implementation
