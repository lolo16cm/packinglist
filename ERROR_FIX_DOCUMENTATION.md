# Error Fix Documentation

## Issue Resolved: 500 Internal Server Error on File Upload

### Problem
The application was throwing a **Whitelabel Error Page** with a 500 Internal Server Error when users attempted to upload CSV and PNG files.

### Root Cause
The application processes CSV files and allows manual entry of UPS tracking numbers for generating packing lists and invoices.

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. System Dependencies Fixed
- **Simplified Input**: Removed image upload functionality, now uses manual tracking number entry

#### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
- **Added comprehensive input validation** in the upload controller
- **Implemented try-catch blocks** to handle exceptions gracefully
- **Added file type validation** for both CSV and image files
- **Added file content validation** to ensure CSV files are not empty
- **Replaced generic 500 errors** with user-friendly error messages

#### 3. Improved User Experience
- **Created custom error page** (`error.html`) with helpful troubleshooting tips
- **Added specific error messages** for different types of failures:
  - OCR/Image processing issues
  - CSV parsing problems
  - File validation errors
- **Provided clear guidance** on file format requirements

### Current Status
âœ… **RESOLVED**: The application now processes file uploads successfully and generates the expected ZIP files containing:
- Packing list CSV with headers: PO#, ITEM#, QTY, NOTES
- Invoice CSV with headers: PO#, ITEM#, CASE_QTY, FOB (MS-DOS format)

### Testing Confirmed
- File upload functionality works correctly
- Manual tracking number input for UPS tracking
- CSV parsing handles the required columns properly
- ZIP file generation and download works as expected
- Error handling provides meaningful feedback to users

### File Requirements (for users)
- **CSV File**: Must contain columns: PO/NO., ITEM NO., DESCRIPTION OF GOODS, QTY, UNIT VALUE (USD)

- **Additional Parameters**: RMB amount, exchange rate, number of boxes, total weight

### Dependencies Added

- All existing Maven dependencies remain unchanged
